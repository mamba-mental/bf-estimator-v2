# Description: This script serves as the main entry point for a weight loss predictor program. It interacts with users to gather necessary inputs, calculates weight loss projections based on various factors, and provides a summary of the results.
# Usage: Run this script in a Python environment to start the weight loss prediction process. It prompts the user for information such as current weight, body fat percentage, and lifestyle details.
# Dependencies: user_interaction, calculations, report_generation, utils (Ensure these modules are available in the same directory or properly installed as packages)
# Version: 1.0.0

# Importing necessary functions from different modules to handle user input, perform calculations, and generate a summary report.
