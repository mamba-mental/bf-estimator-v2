# Description: This script contains unit tests for verifying the functionality of 
# the weight loss prediction module. It tests key functions including RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate) 
# calculation, TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculation, and weight loss prediction progression.
# Usage: This file is intended to be run as a part of a unit testing framework (unittest).
# Dependencies: unittest, datetime, calculations (calculate_rmr, calculate_tdee, predict_weight_loss),
# utils (calculate_age)
